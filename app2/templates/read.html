<p>From the day I get to the dice I honestly don't know how I'm in love with that spin. Later I'm getting know that there is a variety of whirls around the world. I chose to dance according to the way I'm happy and swing like a bird in the sky. Initially, I got the fear of people who judged my swag. But the thing I realized was we should dance for ourselves. Then I overcome those fear and get to the dice fearlessly. Once my legs started dancing, I felt I could forget myself and turn around the world like a fly.  The emotions which were inside the hop will bring enormous happiness to my soul. The big fact in dance was even a zero-size can dance like a pro if there is a passion for that frolic.</p>
